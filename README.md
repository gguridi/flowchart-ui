## Flowchart-UI

This is a small website built to be able to work with [Flowchart](http://flowchart.js.org/)
online in the most straightforward way.

The website uses the local storage to store and update the charts that the user is creating, 
allowing some sort of persistance even without login features. 

## Running Locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
