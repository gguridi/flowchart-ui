## Flowchart-UI

This is a small website built to be able to work with [Flowchart](http://flowchart.js.org/)
online in the most straightforward way.

The website uses the local storage to store and update the charts that the user is creating, 
allowing some sort of persistance even without login features.

The project is automatically deployed to Github Pages so it's available to use without 
installation in the following address:

- https://gguridi.github.io/flowchart-ui/

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `yarn test`
