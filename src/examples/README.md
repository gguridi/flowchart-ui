## Flowchart Examples

These examples are a copy of the ones in [Flowchart](http://flowchart.js.org/). I'm just
using them to create by default an "Example" chart that can be use as initiation
point to continue creating your own charts.

The charts stored here will be randomy used in the website when no bespoke chart has
been created by the user.
